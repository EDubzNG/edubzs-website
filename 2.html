    <h1>Blog #2: What I've Been Up To</h1>
    <h2>8/8/23</h2>
    <h2>It's been a minute since I've done anything with this website, so I thought I would update anyone who cares about what I've been doing. I've taken quite a big break from working on my little projects. The last thing I really worked on was something related to PBJC. I tried out gamemaker to see how it works and I uninstalled it like 15 minutes later. I watched a tutorial on it and it confused the crap out of me. Anyways, here is some non work related stuff i've been up to. I played the new FNaF DLC, I played a few new games, I practiced speedrunning Hello Neighbor, and I beat FNaF 1 4/20 mode. After taking a long break, I am going to be diving right back into work. See you guys in the next blog.</h2>
