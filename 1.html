    <h2>As the title says, welcome to the blogs! My name is E-Dubz, and I make funny crap with my friends. On the home page, you can find all my socials. These blogs are just for the people who want to know what I am up to, and what I am working on. Currently, my main projects are this website, and my game called "Alien Apocalypse" (check it out on my portfolio!). Anyways, see you all in the next blog lol.</h2>
